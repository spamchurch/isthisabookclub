isthisabook.club was an ancient experiment that has been passed through many generations across many years and geographic areas. As it has adapted over the years, the nature of the experiment has adopted to fit the medium of the time. No one knows where the first one was, or who started it. In fact, so much mystery surrounds it that the only trace left is small stickers stuck around cities. Only a few scrambled details are known. For one, it seems to be centered around community events of a book club that doesnâ€™t require reading whatsoever....

Some media theorists think its a multimodal mobilization experiment aimed at blending technologies for community building and ideation.  Some think it involves ghosts of 18th century poets. No one knows for sure. Word is that it was an experiment to curate an anti-normative social gathering in the spirit of the books discussed and to subvert social media and the rest of our <a href = "http://www.spam.church">spam</a>my world. But even that sounds intentionaly vague.

5. Induce a gathering of people who do not know each other to discuss the book. 
6. Repeat 1 + 5 infinitely.

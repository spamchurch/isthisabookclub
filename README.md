Although the infamous book club itself has come and gone, the underlying protocols that powered it live on. 

1. Select a terrifying book that provides insight into reality.
2. Clone this repository and edit `index.html` to contain the location of the meeting, as well as the book title. Post a new website with a thematic url.
3. Order thousands of stickers online from StickerMule with the designs found in the `stickers` folder, being careful the replace the QR code with the one you have selected to match your URL.
4. Post said stickers all over the urban world. 
5. Hold the book club, engage the community and learn from each other.
6. Repeat 1 + 5 infinitely.
